# Sabre Swap Mapper

### Execution

- put unmapped .qasm-Files into "original/" Folder
- set "layout_strategy" and "swap_choose_strategy" when initializing the mapper in main.py
- execute pyhton script via command line "python main.py"

###Notes

The results where calculated using a random feature. 
Set the "swap_choose_strategy" to "trivial" in order to get a static behaviour.

There is an option for a heuristic initial mapping function that is not implemented yet.
Because of organizational reasons I need my grade before the easter break. 
I will try to enhance my algorithm further until then, but you can consider this as my submission.
